In my computational biology course that I took this semester, I had the oppurtunity to learn a little bit of python coding. I had been working mainly with r, so learning python was a bit difficult at first, but there are a lot of similarities between the two languages. 

For example, like you can assign values to variables, so can you in python. One thing that's cool in python however, is that you can do multiple assignments like this. 

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```


```{python}
#This is a python code chunk

animal, flower, color, adjective = "dog", "lily", "purple", "adorable"

#Print out assigned variables
print(color, flower)
print(adjective, animal)
```

Speaking of an adorable dog, look how adorable this doggo is (and no, unfortunately she's not mine, but my brother's)!

Another cool thing about coding with these two language is that we can interchange these languages using R markdown. For example, using python, I create an array (essentially a matrix) and save it as "array1". 

```{python}
#This is a python code chunk
import numpy as np
array1=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
``` 

Next, in an r code chunk, I can ask R to take every value within the matrix "array1" using py$array1 and add 2 to it. By using "py$" we tell r that we are referring to a python code. 

```{r}
#This is an r code chunk
py$array1 + 2
```
