<h5>The two datasets that I will be working with are called “countries” and “X2019”, both of which were found on Kaggle. The dataset “X2019” is a world happiness report for the year 2019 and ranks the countries according to how happy their citizens precieve themselves to be. There are six variables used to explain life evaluations (aka how happy the individuals perceive themselves to be) in this dataset, and they are based on what what literature has previously shown is important to explain differences in life evaluations. The data was collected through a survey called the “Gallup World Poll” and therefore is self-reported. “Country” is the name of the country, ofcourse. The “Overall Rank” represents the ranking of the country on the happiness scale, with higher scores correlating better life evaluations. The “Score” column in the datasets is based on the Cantril ladder which asks respondents to rate their own current lives on a 0-10 scale, with higher scores being the best possible life for them. The remaining columns- “levels of GDP”, “life expectancy”, “generosity”, “social support”, “freedom”, and “corruption” - have no impact on the total “Score” but rather represent how much/what share of the country’s overall “Score” can be explained by each of the six factors. This dataset was interesting as it presents a unique way of mesuring happiness.</h5>

<h5>The second dataset “hdev” is a Human Development Index (HDI) which is a dataset with summary measures of acievements of important dimensions of human development including education attained, gross national income and life expectancy. Information about how this dataset was acquired was obtained is not listed on Kaggle, the source of the dataset. The dataset has 8 variables. The first variable is named “HDI Rank” which ranks the countries in terms of how they rank on the Human Development Index, with a higher rank corresponding to higher levels of human development in the Country. The variable “Continent” groups the countries accorind to the continent they belong to. The next variable “Country” lists 195 countries. The column “Human Development Index (HDI)” has the index which varies between 0 and 1, with values closer to one representing higher levels of human development. “Life expectancy at Birth” is a dimension of health. The column “Expected Years of Education” is the expected years of education for children. While “Mean Years of Education” is measured by the mean years of Education for adults above 25. The “Gross National Icome (GNI) per capita” is the standard of the living dimension which presents the economic health of a country as it represents refers to the size of each country’s economy divided by the population. The last variable, “GNI per capita minus HDI Rank2”, is another means of measuring the living dimension of a country based not just on economy but other factors indicated by HDI such as education and life expectancy. I would like to see if there are certain factors that correlate with a country’s “happiness”.</h5>

<h5>A correlation heatmap is generated using my datast “merge1”, which has all NA values removed. Then, using select_if(), I was able to select only the numeric values which was then piped into cor to create the correlation matrix. This is then piped into ggplot where the aes function is used to create the fill based on the correlation value, Geom_text can then be added to tell the plot what text to add inside the heatmaps. Using size, I was able to change the size of the text smaller to ensure that the values can be read and using aes again inside of geom_text, the x- and y-labels are assigned. The function “scale_fill_gradient2” is used to assign different colors to the heatmap based on the correlation. High (positive) correlations are assigned the color blue and low (negative) correlations are assigned the color red. Using theme, we can further change the plot by changing the angle of the test and the size of the axis labels, as well as add a legend. Based on the plot, we can see that “generosity” has almost no correlation with any of the variables. Additionally, as expected variables such as life expectancy, education, social support, etc, are positively correlated with each other and with other variables in general.</h5>

<h5>In this plot, I create a scatterplot using geom_point() and my dataset, merge1.

However, I wanted to explore how these variables differ across continents as well in the below plot. Here, I use aes() inside of ggplot to assign the x and y-axis which are GNI per capital and Mean Years, respectively. Then, using aes() inside of geom_point, I was able to assign the color of the points according to the continent that country belongs to and the size of the points according to the GNI per capita of that country. Based on this plot, we can observe that the continent of Europe leads the world in terms of the mean years of education and GNI per capita. What’s unexpected in that although many Asian countires are on the higher range in terms of the education acquired, the GNI per capita is much larger than the European countries.</h5>

<h5>One factor that I was especially interested about is how much do the six variables from columns 12:17 in my merged dataset contribute to the overall “happines” or “Score” for the countries. In order to do so, I decided to fact_wrap() by each of these 6 six columns and create a bar plot. I first gathered all the variables excluding the first 11 columns of my merged dataset and saved these gathered variables under the key “var” and the values under “values”. Next I piped this into ggplot and assigned the x and y axis. The x-axis represents the continent that the countries belong to and the y-axis represents the score value. Using geom_bar I was able to create a bar plot while also customizing the x-angle text inside this function. Next, I was then able to facet wrap by the gathered variables using the key “var”. Next, error bars were added to see if there was a large deviation anywhere. Based on the plots, we can tell that GDP per capita, social support, and Healthy life expectancy contribute the most to the happiness of individuals within a country. Additionally, the continent of Oceania seems to given the highest scores consistently across all 6 levels. Freedom to make life choices, perceptions of corruption and Generosity seem to contribute little to the happiness reported by the countries.</h5>

<h5>In this next part, I will be performing a PAM Clustering.The first step is to decide the number of clusters, or k, to use. To determine the number of clusters to use, we can use the “Average Silhouette Method” which determines how well each object lies within its cluster. This method computes the average silhouette width to the optimal number of clusters, k. Ideally, a high average silhouette width indicates a good clustering. Here, I use the silhouette function which is within the “cluster” package to find the average silhouette width for 2-10 clusters. Note: I first selected only my numeric data and saved it as a dataframe called pam_dat. Based on the results, 2 clusters maximize the average silhouette values, with the next best option being 6 clusters.</h5>
